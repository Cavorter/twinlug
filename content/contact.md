You can reach TWINLUG at <twinlug@gmail.com> or by visiting our Yahoo discussion group [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TwinLUG/conversations/messages).  If you are interested in having TWINLUG exhibit our work at your event, please let us know the following information.

-Date, time, and location

-Expected attendance

-Space for exhibit

-What sort of exhibit you'd be interested in, if anything specific

-Any other considerations

Due to the difficulty of fitting everyone's schedules and the work that goes in to some  of our creations we can't promise to attend every event requested.  One thing that is very helpful is to have at least 90 days notice though!  Thanks in advance!
