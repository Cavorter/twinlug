The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday June 14th, 2009 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. Please check the board at the desk to find out which meeting rooms we will be in this time.

This month is likely to be all about BrickWorld preparation and should have some interesting stuff on display.
