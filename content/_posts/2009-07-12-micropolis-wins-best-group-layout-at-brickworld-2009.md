It was a proud day for us on Sunday of [Brickworld 2009](http://www.brickworld.us) when the display area opened and sitting right next to the first ever Micropolis Collaborative Display at Brickworld was the award for ["Best Group Layout"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/billward/3650738520/)!

The display would have been nothing if not for the great work done by everyone who contributed a module to the display:

  * Tom Anderson
  * [Max Braun](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisonfuehrer/)
  * [Roy Cook](http://bighardstuds.blogspot.com/)
  * [Garth Danielson](http://garth.typepad.com/primitive_screwheads/)
  * Gary Dokulil
  * [Christopher Doyle](http://reasonablyclever.com)
  * [Alice Leber-Cook](http://bighardstuds.blogspot.com/)
  * [Matt Holland](http://pbpancho.smugmug.com/)
  * Bill Hutchinson

  * Christopher Van Allen

We would like to thank all of the blogs that posted links to the Bad Day contest and especially all of the posts from [MicroBricks](http://microbricks.blogspot.com/) leading up to the convention.

We would also like to thank everyone who stopped by the display all through Brickworld and talked to us about the project. Watching people see the display the first time and start to notice all of the details was a privilege in itself, but being able to talk to some of you about the project and how it was put together was reward enough for putting it together.

We plan to be back next year with a bigger and better display and hope that anyone who was inspired by this year's display will bring their own modules to contribute!
