TwinLUG member and LEGO Ambassador Roy Cook has completed his replicas of the [Cathedral of St Paul](http://www.cathedralsaintpaul.org/) and [Minnesota State Capital](http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/msc/) buildings and the will both soon be on public display for everyone to appreciate them. 200 hours of work assembling approximately 120,000 LEGO bricks is a fairly epic feat for even the more jaded members of the LEGO community so be sure to take a chance to have a look at the results yourself.
