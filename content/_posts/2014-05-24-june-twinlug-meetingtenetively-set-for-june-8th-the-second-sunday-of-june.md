Due to the almost usual conflict with Father's Day we will be changing which sunday we meet on.  June 15ht is Father's day and the space we meet in is unavailable June 22, which leaves June 8th or June 29th as the viable options.  As of Publishing(May 24th) the majority expressing a preference have expressed June 8th as the better option.

This date is subject to change via discussion in the TwinLUG yahoo group so watch there for the latest (or to express your preference if you wish).
