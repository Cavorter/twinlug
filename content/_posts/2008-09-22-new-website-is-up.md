After a brief absence, the TwinLUG website is finally back. We plan to use this site for news and information about the group along with links to our member's various activities elsewhere on the web. Be sure to check back or subscribe to the RSS feeds to keep up!

If you have any questions about the group please visit [our active mailing list hosted by Yahoo Groups](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/)Â and join in the conversation. We are always interested in hearing from other LEGO fans in the Twin Cities metro area and from around the world.
