At the August meeting, TwinLUG member Max suggested that the group attempt to build parts of a Micro scale city for the October meeting that we might want to display for public events and etc. After much discussion about the design details and a month of inventive building the first TwinLUG MicroCity was assembled during the September meeting. After the meeting several intrepid members installed the MOC, now dubbed "Micropolis" in a display case at the Lego Imagination Center store at the Mall of America for everyone to enjoy.

TwinLUG member Garth has <a href="http://garth.typepad.com/primitive_screwheads/2008/09/twinlugs-micropolis.html" target="_blank">posted a great entry in his blog</a> about the model along with pictures of the assembled display.

We hope to be posting a detailed spec for others wanting to build their own modules and cities compatible with our design.
