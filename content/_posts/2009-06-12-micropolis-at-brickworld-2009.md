TwinLUG is bringing Micropolis to BrickWorld in a big way with a collaborative build that is likely to be the largest Micropolis assembly yet. Be sure to look for it in the Event Hall, and it's not too late to bring your own module to add to the display!

If you are planning on bringing a module please be sure to carefully [read through the specifications](http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/) to ensure that it will fit with the rest of the modules in the build. If you need inspiration, be sure to have a look at [the results of the Bad Day In Micropolis Contest that was hosted by our friend Chris at ReasonablyClever.com](http://reasonablyclever.com/lego/contest/badday/index.html) or any of the [images on Flickr tagged with "Micropolis"](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Micropolis&w=all).

We are looking forward to seeing everyone next week in Chicago!
