Garth has once again posted notes from the most recent TwinLUG meeting at the Rondo Community Library in St Paul. Highlights:

  * Esther made an appearance and was given the signed "card" object. It was great to see her up and about.
  * A prospective new group member dropped by to find out about the group. We hope to see you again Tom!
  * Post-event reports for both Fallcon and TCBX
