The [Greater Midwest LEGO Train Club (GMLTC)](http://gmltc.org) is the oldest of the local LEGO groups and this past year has found a permanent home for their fantastic display at the offices of [BrickMania](http://brickmania.com) in North East Minneapolis. The new location has allowed them to have an open house on the second Saturday of each month where they get to show their layout to the public.

Recently they extended an invitation to TwinLUG to display Micropolis in their space and so we would like to extend an invitation for everyone to come see both the GMLTC train display as well as the TwinLUG Micropolis layout this coming Saturday August 13, 2011 at BrickMania from 10am till 4pm.
