TwinLUG has a nice looking display set up at the Brickmania location for their December Open Houses.

There's a nice variety of material to be seen. Stop in if you can.

They are open December 10, 17 and 31. 10AM to 4PM

There is a charge of $5 per person or $10 for a family.

**Brickmania** is located at 1620 Central Ave NE in Suite 170.

More information on the location and directions can be found at the [Brickmania](http://brickmaniatoys.com/directions/) site.
