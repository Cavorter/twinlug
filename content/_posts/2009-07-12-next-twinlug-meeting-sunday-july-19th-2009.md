The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday July 19th, 2009 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. Please check the board at the desk to find out which meeting rooms we will be in this time.

This month will likely be lots of discussion about Brickworld and some talk about what to do next year along with the usual fun and discussion all about LEGO bricks. Come join us!
