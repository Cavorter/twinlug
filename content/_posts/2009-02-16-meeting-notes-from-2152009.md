The February TwinLUG meeting was held once again at the Rondo Community Library in St Paul, MN. Garth has as usual <a href="http://garth.typepad.com/primitive_screwheads/2009/02/twinlug-meeting-21509.html" target="_blank">posted a great summary of the meeting on his blog</a>.

We would like to thank everyone for bringing all of their Micropolis modules. The resulting assembly was stunning in it's size, diversity, and was a perfect showcase of the building skills of the individuals in the group. Pictures of the assembled city should be available from several sources soon.
