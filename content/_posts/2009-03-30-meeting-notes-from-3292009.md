Another month and another TwinLUG meeting, though somewhat later in the month than we usually have it. This month two new people dropped in. A big hello to both Jeremy and Dean! Hopefully we didn't scare you off.

Garth has his <a href="http://garth.typepad.com/primitive_screwheads/2009/03/twinlug-meeting-32909.html" target="_blank">usual summary up on his blog</a>.

For better or worse this was a fairly quiet meeting. Several new Micropolis modules made appearances including a Drive-In Theater by Matt and and a nice little urban theater and construction site from Jeremy. I showed off the possibilities of the proposed bluff spec for the Micropolis modules.

There were a few business items of note:

  * Request for ideas for a good item or items to put up for the Esther Walner Memorial Charity Auction at <a href="Esther Walner Memorial Charity Auction" target="_blank">BrickWorld</a>. It's good to see her passing honored by the larger AFoL community.
  * Also related to BrickWorld, TwinLUG in past years has brought collaborative displays spelling out various words ("LEGO" and "TwinLUG" that I am aware of) and with the new Micropolis collaborative display scheduled for this year there was discussion about what to do. Several ideas were bandied about and we hope everyone enjoys what we come up with.
  * Speaking of Micropolis, keep an eye out on Chris Doyle's <a href="http://reasonablyclever.com/" target="_blank">Reasonably Clever</a> site this week for a related announcement. We're all pretty excited and the timing should be good for people planning on going to BrickWorld.

We would like to thank everyone attending the meetings and look forward to the next.
