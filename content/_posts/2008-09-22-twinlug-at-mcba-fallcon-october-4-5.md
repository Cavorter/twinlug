TwinLUG is going to the <a href="http://fallcon.mncba.com/" target="_blank">MCBA Fallcon Comic Book Celebration</a> occuring on October 4th and 5th at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. If you are going to the convention look for our table where we hope to have Micropolis and some other comic book inspired MOCs on display!
