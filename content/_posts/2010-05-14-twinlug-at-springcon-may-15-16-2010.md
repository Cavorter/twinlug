Come see the creations of TwinLUG members at the [MCBA SpringCon](http://midwestcomicbook.com/) comics convention! TwinLUG will be bringing out an enormous Micropolis layout, a tremendous underwater adventure themed display, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff all built by from the creative minds of our members. Oh yeah, and there's some really cool comics related stuff too.

We will be manning our tables at the State Fair Grandstand both Saturday May 15 and Sunday May 16 so we can show off a little bit and answer any questions that you have.

Admission to the event is $11 (or $10 with a canned food item) but parking is free. [Click here for more information about directions and parking](http://midwestcomicbook.com/?page_id=2).

We look forward to seeing you there!
