The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday October 19th 2008 at the [Rondo Community Library](http://www.stpaul.lib.mn.us/locations/rondo.html) in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street and we are usually in the large meeting room right off the lobby.

There is no official agenda set for the meeting yet. If there is something you would like to discuss please post a message to our [Yahoo Groups discussion list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/).

We hope to see you at the meeting!
