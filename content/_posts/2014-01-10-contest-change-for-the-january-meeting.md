As part of a promotion for the upcoming release of "The LEGO Movie", the contest for the January meeting has been changed to builds inspired by the movie. No worries if you already were working on an entry for the "Captured Motion" contest as that will instead be moved to the February meeting. For more information on the contest change head over to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/TwinLUG" target="_blank">the mailing list</a>.
