The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday June 13, 2010 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. Please check the board at the desk to find out which meeting rooms we will be in this time.

The meeting has been moved from the usual third Sunday of the month because of a conflict with [BrickWorld](http://www.brickworld.us) in Chicago which several of our members will be attending. This meeting will likely be primarily preparation and coordination for BrickWorld but if you are not going this might just be the best time to see what everyone is taking or sending.
