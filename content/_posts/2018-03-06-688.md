March Agenda

&nbsp;

We’ll be having a build challenge this month.

Flora &#8211; plants, flowers, trees, and the like. No size limits or other restrictions.
  
Bring your build to the meeting and be entered into a draw for a prize.

&nbsp;

This meeting will be directly after the science museum show. I think starting a post evaluation of shows would be a good practice.

So we will do a quick recap and take notes of anyone’s thoughts, things that worked and/or concerns.

We will also be finalizing the bylaws for the year.
