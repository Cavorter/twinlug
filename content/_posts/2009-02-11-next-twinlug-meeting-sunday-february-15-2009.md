Â 

The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday February 15th 2009 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. Look for a placard on the front desk to indicate which room we are in this month.

This month we are hoping to assemble all the current Micropolis modules to get an idea of the state of the city. Bring all of your old or new modules as well as your cameras.
