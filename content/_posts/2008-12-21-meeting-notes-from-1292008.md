The last meeting of the 2008 was held on December 9th at the Rondo Community Library. As usual Garth has <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/message/1127" target="_blank">posted a good run down of the meeting to the mailing list</a>. A few highlights:Â 

  * In the spirit of the holidays we held a Dirty Brickster gift exchange. There was relatively little gift stealing (as per the rules of the game) but everyone who participated seemed to be pretty happy with what they ended up with.
  * Roy brought in a mock-up of his Minnesota State Capital model.
  * Several great new Micropolis modules debuted.

It was a fun meeting and a good capstone to a great year.
