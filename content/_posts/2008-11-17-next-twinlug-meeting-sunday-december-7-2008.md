The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday December 7th 2008 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. We will be meeting in room "B", which is the western half of the double room we had for November's meeting. You can find the room by going around behind the front desk. "B" is the second meeting room.

In the spirit of the winter holidays December's meeting will have a "Dirty Brickster" gift sharing. Notes and information about that event will be posted soon. 

We hope to see you at the meeting!
