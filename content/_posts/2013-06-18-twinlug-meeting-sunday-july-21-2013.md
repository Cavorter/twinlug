The next TwinLUG meeting will be Sunday July 21 at Brickmania in Minneapolis, MN. BrickMania is located at 1620 Central Ave NE in Suite 170. More information on the location and directions can be found at the <a href="http://brickmaniatoys.com/open-house/" target="_blank">BrickMania site</a>.

We will be judging the results of the "Minty Fresh" building competition and hopefully hearing from members about the displays at various events in June and July.
