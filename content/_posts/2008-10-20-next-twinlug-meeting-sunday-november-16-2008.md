The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday November 16th 2008 at the Rondo Community Library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. We will **not** be in our usual room right off the lobby but will instead be in rooms "A" and "B" to the left of the main desk.

There is no official agenda set for the meeting yet though there was very tentative discussion of another Parts Draw and Roy in particular voiced a request to see more Micropolis modules. If there is something you would like to discuss please post a message to our [Yahoo Groups discussion list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/).

We hope to see you at the meeting!
