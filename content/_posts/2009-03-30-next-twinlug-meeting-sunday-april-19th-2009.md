The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday April 19th, 2009 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. We should be in Rooms A&B behind the check out desk but check the placard at the front desk if you can't find us.

There is currently nothing on the official agenda but please join us for fun conversation with fellow LEGO enthusiasts!
