The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday January 25th 2009 at the Rondo Community library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. I can't find the note that said which meeting room we will be in but if you ask at the front desk they should be able to tell you where we are.

At the December meeting Roy challenged everyone to come up with a micro-scale model of the Minnesota State Capital and/or the <a href="http://www.cathedralsaintpaul.org/" target="_blank">Cathedral of St. Paul in St Paul, MN</a>. There is a target part count of less than 100 parts and a strong recomendation for not using rare or unusual parts so that the eventual set can be duplicated easily.

We hope to see you at the first meeting of 2009!
