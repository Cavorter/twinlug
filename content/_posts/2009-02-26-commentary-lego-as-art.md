TwinLUG member and LEGO Ambassador <a href="http://bighardstuds.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Roy T. Cook</a> wrote this essay on the aesthetics of LEGO building . Although originally written at the request of Joe Meno for the magazine <a href="http://brickjournal.com" target="_blank">BrickJournal</a> it now looks like it will not be published there so Roy thought he share it on our site. Enjoy!
