The Micropolis specification got a fun mention in [an article about the ups and downs of using LEGO for urban planning](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/design/2013/02/imagine-playing-sim-city-real-life/4652/). It's worth the time to read and great to see our little idea get noticed in so many interesting places.
