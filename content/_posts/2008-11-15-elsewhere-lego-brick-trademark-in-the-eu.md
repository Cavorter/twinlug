There was [an article on Ars Technica this last week](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081113-lego-loses-eu-trademark-on-bricks-prepares-for-clone-wars.html) about The LEGO Group loosing a court battle about whether the iconic 2x4 LEGO Brick is covered as a Trademark or not. The article itself is an interesting read, but [analysis by Benjamin Hauger, Esq. on the TwinLUG mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/message/1007) is very much worth reading to help understand what the court decision really means.
