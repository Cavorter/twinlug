![Bad Day for Micropolis Contest!](http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/cjdoyle/contest/title_400.jpg)

Our good friend Chris Doyle at [Reasonably Clever](http://reasonablyclever.com) has partnered with us to do a contest with some excellent prizes for people who build their own fantastic Micropolis Modules! TwinLUG members Roy Cook and Max Braun are even two of the four judges, along with Chris and special guest judge Mariann Asanuma of [ModelBuildingSecrets.com](http://modelbuildingsecrets.com/).

Be sure to brush up on the [official Micropolis spec](http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/) and then head over to the [contest page](http://reasonablyclever.com/lego/contest/badday/index.html) for full details and enter your module!
