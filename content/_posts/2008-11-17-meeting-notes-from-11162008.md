Garth has once again [posted to the mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/message/1032) a nice round up for the most recent meeting.

I would just like to amplify his comment about Tom's Micropolis module, which is an incredibly gorgeous replica of the "Old Main" building from Hamline University. Hopefully we'll be able to get pictures at some point to share.

Thanks again for everyone who showed up and joined in the fun of the parts draw and the general conversation.
