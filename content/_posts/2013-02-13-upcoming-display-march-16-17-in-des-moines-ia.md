Our friend Chris Hettinger is starting his own group, [IowaLUG](http://iowalug.com/), and has invited TwinLUG to display at the launch event on March 16th and 17th at the [Science Center of Iowa (SCI)](http://www.sciowa.org/). We'll be there with Micropolis and some other displays and helping out with the group assembly of Chris's spectacular 60,000 piece model of the SCI building.

It's a bit of a trip from the Twin Cities but if you know anyone down in the area be sure to mention it to them! More information is available on the [SCI event calendar](http://www.sciowa.org/event-calendar/?id_category=all&view_by=d&day=2013-03-16) or on their [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/320704564714925/).
