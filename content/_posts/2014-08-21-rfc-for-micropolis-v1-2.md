Recently there has been some talk about updating the Micropolis specification (last updated four years ago!) and so <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/micropolis/discuss/72157646294194100/" target="_blank">a discussion has been started in the Flickr Micropolis group for revising the specification to version 1.2</a>. There is currently no timeline for when the new version might be published but we'll be sure to mention here when it does.
