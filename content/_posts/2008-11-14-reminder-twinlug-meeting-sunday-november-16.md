The next full TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30PM Sunday November 16th 2008 at the Rondo Community Library in St Paul, MN. The library is located at 461 N. Dale Street. We will **not** be in our usual room right off the lobby but will instead be in rooms "A" and "B" to the left of the main desk.

Thanks to Roy doing the grunt work there will be a Parts Draw!

Garth will be returning Micropolis modules since we appear to have lost our display case at the Mall Of America LEGO Store. Hopefully there will be further news on that front as well.

If there is something you would like to discuss please post a message to our [Yahoo Groups discussion list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/).

We hope to see you at the meeting!
