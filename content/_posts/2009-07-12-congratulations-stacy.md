The LEGO Group has announced the new [LEGO Ambassadors](http://www.brothers-brick.com/2009/07/08/cycle-7-lego-ambassadors-announced/) and we were ecstatic to see that Stacy Sterling has been accepted as one of the new Ambassadors. We're sure she'll do a great job over the next year and hope to congratulate her in person at one of the next meetings.
