The next full TwinLUG meeting will be Sunday JuneMinneapolis, MN. **The start time is still being determined** but will be much earlier than usual, probably. BrickMania is located atin Suite 170. More information on the location and directions can be found at the <a href="http://brickmaniatoys.com/open-house/" target="_blank">BrickMania site</a>.

The early portion of the meeting will be primarily for sorting items to existing members with the correct standing, but later in the meeting will be the usual chatting, showing recent work or works in progress, and the usual socializing.
