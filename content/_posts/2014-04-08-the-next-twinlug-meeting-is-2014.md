April 20th is Easter Sunday, discussions underway in regards to a date change.

Feedback thus far it appears we will be meeting on Sunday April 27th 2014.

The next TwinLUG meeting will be 1:30 pm Sunday \*\*tentatively\*\* April 27 2014 at Brickmania in Minneapolis, MN. BrickMania is located at 1620 Central Ave NE in Suite 170. More information on the location and directions can be found at the BrickMania site.

The April's contest subject is Micropolis. Qualified modules are any
  
quarter, half, or full block modules. Modules larger than a full block
  
do not qualify. Any subject or building type is fine as long as it
  
conforms to the Micropolis 1.1 specification for a standard, water or
  
bluff module published at <a href="http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/" target="\_blank" rel="nofollow" data-rapid\_p="1">http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/</a>
