TwinLUG is a group of adult LEGO enthusiasts who get together regularly to share ideas, trade parts, and generally be a part of the larger worldwide LEGO community. We enjoy publicly showing our own creations in local and national venues when the opportunity arises and generally try to provide a local resource for people who are interested in LEGO as a hobby at any level.

In 2009 our group published a specification for the Micropolis group build projects that has since been used by individuals and groups all around the world to facilitate an easy way to showcase the different ideas and styles of building inherent to any community.

Our group is always looking for new members and we only ask that you be 18 years of age or older. 14 to 17 year old enthusiasts are welcome but must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.

We have a regular monthly meeting at [BrickMania ToyWorks](http://gmltc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=16) that is usually on the third Sunday of the month 1:30 to 4 pm, but be sure to check the main page for information about the next meeting.

Please feel free to comment on posts here or participate in <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TwinLUG/" target="_blank">our Yahoo Groups discussion list</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!
