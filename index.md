# What is TwinLUG?

TwinLUG is a group of adult LEGO enthusiasts who get together regularly to share ideas, trade parts, and generally be a part of the larger worldwide LEGO fan community. We enjoy publicly showing our own creations in local and national venues when the opportunity arises and generally try to provide a local resource for people who are interested in LEGO as a hobby at any level.

# What is [Micropolis](micropolis-micro-city-standard)?

In 2008 our group [published a specification for the Micropolis group build projects](micropolis-micro-city-standard) that has since been used by individuals and groups all around the world to facilitate an easy way to showcase the different ideas and styles of building inherent to any community.

# Can I become a member?

Our group is always looking for new members and we only ask that you be 18 years of age or older. 14 to 17 year old enthusiasts are welcome but must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.

# When is the next meeting?

We have a regular monthly meeting at [The Works Museum](https://theworks.org/) that is usually on the third Sunday of the month from 1:30 to 4 pm, but be sure to check the calendar on the member group or our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TWINLUG/) for details about the next meeting.

# Where can I see your creations?

We display at various events throughout the year around the Twin Cities area as well as occaisionally travel outside the state, but for a quick glance at what some of our members are building take a look at our [Flickr Group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/twinlug/pool/).

# Can your group help out with my project or event?

Maybe. The members of the group have a diverse set of talents and experiences but almost all of us have day jobs that we keep so we can afford to buy new brick, and maybe food. If there is a project or event that you would like to see if we could help out with please [send us an email](mailto:contact@twinlug.com) or post something on the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TWINLUG/).

# Can you please give me some of your extra parts?

No.
